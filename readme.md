## Project Overview: 

In this project, a pendulum is attached to a spinning frame. The frame has dimensions, 

$h_1 = 0.2~m$

$w_1 = 0.1~m$

and the pendulum length is $L=0.15~m$ with a $m=0.1~kg$ point mass at the end of the system. The pendulum swings in the $x'-z'-plane$ as it rotates at a constant speed, $\Omega$

Your team's goal is to 

- build the equations of motion using Lagrange and least action $L=T-V$
- solve for the motion for a slow rotation speed and a fast rotation speed
- visualize the solution with plots and animations
